## Security and Vulnerability Reporting

The faker-ruby core contributors take security very seriously and investigate all reported vulnerabilities.

If you would like to report a vulnerablity or have a security concern regarding faker-ruby, please report it by contacting the current security coordinators (Stefanni Brasil stefanni@hexdevs.com and Thiago Araujo thd@hexdevs.com).

The information you share with the faker-ruby core contributors as part of this process will be kept confidential within the team, unless or until we need to share information upstream with our dependent libraries' core teams, at which point we will notify you.

If a vulnerability is first reported by you, we will credit you with the discovery in the public disclosure.
